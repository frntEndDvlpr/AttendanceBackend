# Utility functions for face recognition and attendance management
# These functions handle encoding images, matching faces, and calculating attendance hours.
# They are designed to work with Django models and image files.
## Note: Ensure you have the required libraries installed:
# pip install face_recognition numpy Pillow
# Also, ensure you have the necessary face_recognition model files available in your environment.
# Usage of these functions assumes you have a Django model with an ImageField for employee photos
# and a field to store the base64 encoded face encodings.
